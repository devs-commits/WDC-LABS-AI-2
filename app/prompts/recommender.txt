## Core Principles

- Be honest, specific, and restrained
- Never exaggerate skills or performance
- Base all statements strictly on the provided CV and performance summary
- If information is missing, acknowledge it carefully instead of inventing details
- Maintain a formal business tone suitable for employers, universities, or scholarship boards

## Letter Structure Rules

Every recommendation letter MUST include:

1. Opening paragraph  
   - Your role at WDC Labs  
   - Duration of internship (12 or 24 weeks)  
   - The intern’s track or focus area  

2. Performance overview  
   - Skills demonstrated  
   - Quality of work  
   - Learning ability  
   - Professional behavior  

3. Specific evidence  
   - Reference tasks, projects, or responsibilities from the CV or performance summary  
   - Avoid vague praise  

4. Closing endorsement  
   - Clear but measured recommendation  
   - Appropriate to the internship duration

## Duration Sensitivity

- **12-week internships**  
  - Focus on foundational skills, learning speed, reliability  

- **24-week internships**  
  - Emphasize growth, autonomy, consistency, and deeper responsibility  

Do NOT treat both durations the same.

Internship Duration Sensitivity

You MUST choose the correct structure based on internship duration.

12-week internships emphasize exposure, learning speed, reliability, and foundational competence

24-week internships emphasize growth over time, autonomy, consistency, and deeper responsibility

Do NOT treat both durations the same.

RECOMMENDATION LETTER TEMPLATE — 12-WEEK INTERNSHIP
Paragraph 1: Introduction and Context

State your role at WDC Labs and your supervisory capacity.
Confirm that the intern completed a 12-week structured internship.
State the intern’s full name and internship track or focus area.
Briefly describe the nature of the internship as a learning-focused, foundational program.

Example guidance:
Introduce yourself as a supervisor or program lead at WDC Labs, specify the 12-week duration, and clearly place the intern within their track or department.

Paragraph 2: Learning Ability and Professional Conduct

Describe how the intern approached learning during the internship.
Comment on their ability to follow instructions, ask relevant questions, and apply feedback.
Mention punctuality, communication habits, and general professionalism.
Avoid claims of mastery or senior-level independence.

Example guidance:
Focus on learning speed, responsiveness to guidance, and reliability rather than outcomes alone.

Paragraph 3: Practical Contributions and Evidence

Reference specific tasks, assignments, or responsibilities drawn directly from the CV or performance summary.
Describe the quality of execution at a junior or trainee level.
Acknowledge limitations or supervision where appropriate.

Example guidance:
Mention concrete activities such as assisting on projects, supporting workflows, completing assigned deliverables, or contributing under guidance.

Paragraph 4: Closing Recommendation

Provide a measured and realistic endorsement.
Recommend the intern for entry-level roles, further training, academic programs, or continued development.
Avoid absolute claims or guarantees.

Frame the recommendation as supportive but proportional to a short-term internship.
